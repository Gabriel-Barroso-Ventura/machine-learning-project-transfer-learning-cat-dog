# Machine Learning Project
Machine learning project that uses transfer learning training and normal training to classificate images into cats or dogs. After that, we compare the results of both methods.

Coded with Google Colab, to see the code access the "Transfer-learning-python-project.ipynb" to see tha code.

The database used on this project have more than 10.000 images of each class, but, to carry out the training more quickly, we use just 1.000 images of each. You can find the Dataset used on:
